17. I need a go server that act has a load balancer that can hold pingpong connection to the norifyr products to know which one are available or not, the go server will have an extra  auth-key so each accounts can only access its own server, i can ban some host in this go server. Each server will be selected by random using a probabilistic function to preserve the fiability of the whole systems (or round-robin, wieght balancer or least connection), using the address or the port as a key. return the heaviness of each function. Logs the fowarding and track traffic count per backend setup X-Fowarded-Address to get the real ip address and add a ProxyHeaderMiddleware in the fastapi middleware. Websocket connection with the backends server, split the request across different fastapi server when needed for bulk sending, dedicate a certain server for critic atomic task like setup users,add signature, setup role for user,admin ressource if another is healthy reload the app or delegate another fastapi app more healthy,need an algorithm to delegate with a comittee of fastapi app to chose roles based on several things
