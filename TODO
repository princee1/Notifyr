# TODO

1. Introduce local model like BERT or LLAMA, OpenAI realtime API, or OpenAI remote
2. Various phone number for multiples means like menu, otp, simple message, and other
3. Redis subscriber to subscribe to any change in the redis backend with the server
4. Monitoring and Alerts: in a discord serber or other any webhook server
5. logging and auditing
6. Fix __init__ file to export only needed definition
7. Upgrading calls to change response
8. Gather input and wait
9. gather feedback
10. SDK with OpenAPI ?
11. check wether the celery beat is running ?
12. Redis Cache for LLM responses
13. WhatsApp
14. Quit after make register?
15. I need a go server that act has a load balancer that can hold pingpong connection to the norifyr products to know which one are available or not, the go server will have an extra  auth-key so each accounts can only access its own server, i can ban some host in this go server. Each server will be selected by random using a probabilistic function to preserve the fiability of the whole systems (or round-robin, wieght balancer or least connection), using the address or the port as a key. return the heaviness of each function. Logs the fowarding and track traffic count per backend setup X-Fowarded-For to get the real ip address and add a ProxyHeaderMiddleware in the fastapi middleware. Websocket connection with the backends server, split the request across different fastapi server when needed for bulk sending, dedicate a certain server for critic atomic task like setup users,add signature, setup role for user,admin ressource if another is healthy reload the app or delegate another fastapi app more healthy,need an algorithm to delegate with a comittee of fastapi app to chose roles based on several things
16. Celery Async?
17. Webhook to email status code,
18. reactive x to wait for redis backend result
19. public route for redirecting
20. Set timezone and language with cookies and date for template
21. Check Cereberus registry in the static values
22. Verify Email before sending, and deactivate bounced contacts
23. Always verify status before sending a promotion, subscription status , and active user or other with FilterPipe
24. ADOPT RCS (Rich Communication Service) when it is available !
25. Automate Wrapper in UseLimiter
26. Features for emails: verify email(potentially implement our own or using a tools), monitoring email( with return path and image), hosting email (postfix,dovecot and more), read email, try to improve deliverability, rotate proxys when sending emails
27. Have a distributed implementation for subject subscribing using redis and rxPy
28. Have landing page and a better workflow for contacts and campaings...
